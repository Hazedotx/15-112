This game is basically a dungeon explorer. The main goal of the game is to explore the main dungeon completely, but it isnt that simple

While exploring, there is a chance you stumble into a dungeon with varying difficulty. Depending on the difficulty, the amount of enemies increases
When you beat the dungeon, you resume your exploration of the main dungeon.

There is also a chance you can find different types of weapons lying on the ground whilst exploring.
The big hammer weapon one shots all the enemies because I got tired of clearing the waves legitametely every time

I wish I had more time to add more enemy types, weapon types, a homescreen, a setting screen, an actual life system for the player, and more.
